# dotfiles
Contains all my useful dotfiles

.bspwmrc    is ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
.sxhkdrc    is ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc
.compton    is ~/.config/compton/compton.conf (I think?)
.Xinitrc    is ~/.Xinitrc
.bashrc     is ~/.bashrc
.bash_aliases is ~/.bash_aliases

I typically put them in their appropriate directories and then symlink them
in convenient locations like ~ so I can get to them easier.
